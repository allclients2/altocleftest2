## About this fork
This fork extends [Miran's fork of altoclef](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef). This fork is meant to add features that I personally like, and maybe some versions I want to port
this mod to, like 1.18.2.

## Supported versions:
- 1.20.6
- 1.20.5
- 1.20.4
- 1.20.2
- 1.20.1
- 1.18.2

*note: All the versions use the "same release" of Alto clef, although some of them use older versions of baritone.* 


## How it works

Take a look at this [Guide from the wiki](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef/wiki/1:-Documentation:-Big-Picture)
or this [Video explanation](https://youtu.be/q5OmcinQ2ck?t=387)


## Download

**Note:** After installing, please move/delete your old baritone configurations if you have any. Preexisting baritone
configurations will interfere with alto clef and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in the future.
