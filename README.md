## Downloads
- ### [Click for Latest Nightly Artifacts (Recommended)](https://nightly.link/allclients2/altocleftest2/workflows/gradle/main/Artifacts.zip)
- ### [Click for Releases](https://github.com/allclients2/altocleftest2/releases)
Releases may be more stable, but pretty Nightly builds are reliable enough...

**Note:** After installing, please move/delete your old baritone configurations if you have any. Preexisting baritone
configurations will interfere with altoclef and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in the future.


## About this fork
This fork extends [Miran's fork of altoclef](https://github.com/allclients2/altocleftest2). This fork is meant to add features that I personally like, and maybe some versions I want to port
this mod to, like 1.18.2. This is also a very experimental branch, if you experience an issue while using, feel free to create an issue on this repo!

### Supported versions:
- 1.20.*
  - 1.20.6
  - 1.20.5
  - 1.20.4
  - 1.20.2
  - 1.20.1
- 1.18.*
  - 1.18.2

*note: All the versions use the "same release" of Alto clef, although some of them may utilize older versions of baritone.*
