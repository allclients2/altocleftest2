# TODO

### Misc
- Implement configs.
- Allow any bed color when crafting beds from wool.
- Add cherry blossom wood as a valid wood type or something? It doesn't seem to work properly atm.
- Maybe add some sort of system that finds and uses seed of the current world?
- Add Farming?
- Fix open inventory while crafting in inventory for 1.18.2+

### Common death causes
- Improve escaping from lava.
- Do not hit pigmen in the nether (or implement a special behaviour when do).
- Prevent from looking endermen in the eyes.
- Maybe avoid bastions somehow?

### Debug
- Fix Obsidian task lagging so badly..


### Chores
- Check the minecraft version for the preprocessor's if-statements. (Frequently not checked whilst adding 1.18.2 support)
- Get rid of the baritone settings from BotBehavior class (Possibly move it into its own class)
